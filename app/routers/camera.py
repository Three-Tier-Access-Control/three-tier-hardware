    # This is a demo of running face recognition on live video from your webcam. It's a little more complicated than the
    # other example, but it includes some basic performance tweaks to make things run a lot faster:
    #   1. Process each video frame at 1/4 resolution (though still display it at full resolution)
    #   2. Only detect faces in every other frame of video.

    # PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.

    # specific demo. If you have trouble installing it, try any of the other demos that don't require it instead.
